# Arch DWM
## My current DWM config for ArchLinux
Minimal setup for Arch, including:
- dwm 
- dmenu - to launch applications
- st - terminal
- slstatus - info in top corner
- setup with necessary files
## Setup guide
1. Clone this repo into your root `~/`  
    I would suggest renaming this directory to `.suckless` or `.dwm`. 
2. Run the `setup.sh` that is provided.
3. Reboot your machine
4. After logging in, dwm should open automaticly

## TODO
- invert mouse scroll for touchpad
- test setup script
- make popups open at the center
- improve slstatus
- add patch for layouts per tag
- rice the shit out of this
